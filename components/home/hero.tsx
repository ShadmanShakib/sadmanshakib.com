            A veterinary science graduate from Bangladesh, I discovered my passion for web
            development during the pandemic. Self-taught in JavaScript, React, and Next.js,
            I&apos;ve successfully built numerous projects for clients, combining my scientific
            background with tech skills. I thrive on learning and tackling new challenges in the
            ever-evolving tech world. Always eager to innovate and create, I&apos;m seeking
            opportunities to apply my unique blend of analytical thinking and coding expertise to
            build impactful solutions.
